# Instagram Follow-Back Checker

This is a Python script that checks which accounts you follow that donâ€™t follow you back.

## How to Use

1. Download your Instagram data from the Instagram website and extract.
2. Place `followers_1.json` and `following.json` in the same folder as `main.py`.
3. Run the script:
4. Throw curses at whomever doesnt follow you back #optional

```bash
python main.py
```
- Instagram's data formats can change over time; this script is prone to breaking at any time. 
- However, if you can use GitHub then you probably know how to code a new one.
